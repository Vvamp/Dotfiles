# Vvamp's Dotfiles
A collection of my dotfiles 

## Introduction
This repository is a collection of my dotfiles. Dotfiles are linux configuration files for various
programs. They generally start with a dot and thus the name 'dotfiles'. 

Since I might have different setups for differrent window mangers and distro's, I have categorized
it in different branches. Each branch has the name: WM/ThemeName. So, for instance:
BSPWM/PurplePokemon. 

## Usage
Clone this repository to your home drive and checkout to the preferred branch.
